What is stored on activation record?
1. values of all parameters. (copy or address of pointer)
2. local variables
3. return address - address of the caller's instruction immediately following the call
4. dynamic link - pointer to caller's activation record. Why is this needed?
5. return value if non-void function

Some small recursive functions:

unsigned int factorial (unsigned int n) {
	if (n == 0) return 1;
	else return (n * factorial(n-1));
}

x^n:
double power(double x, unsigned int n) {
	if (n == 0) return 1;
	else return (x * power(x, n-1));
}

tail recursion: use of only one recursive call at the very end of a function implementation.
		no advantage over iteration.

nontail recursion: better clarity than its iterative counterparts.
see reveseString example.

excessive recursion
nested
indirect

fibonacci:

int fib(int n) {
	if (n < 2) 
		return n;
	else 
		return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);

}
