Deletion a node in a BST
------------------------
There are 3 cases:

1. The node has no children
Set appropriate pointer in the parent to NULL.

2. The node has only one child
The parent's pointer to that node is reset to point to the node's child.

3. The node has 2 children
Deletion by merging or deletion ny copying.

Deletion by merging:
====================
Makes one tree out of the two subtrees of the node and then attaches it to the node's parent.

1. Find the greatest key in the left subtree and make it the parent of the right subtree. 
Replace node with node's left child if node is not root.
OR
2. Find the smallest element in the right subtree and make it the parent of the left subtree. 
Replace node with node's right child if node is not root.

1 is preferred. Why??? 

Deletion by copying:
====================

Balancing a tree:
=================
1. Using an array:

2. Using rotations:
